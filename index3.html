    <h1>Top 20 High-Risk Payment Processors for CBD and Supplement Brands (2025)</h1>
    <p>If you're running a CBD or supplement brand with subscriptions, you’ve likely been frozen out by Stripe, PayPal, or Square. These payment processors specialize in high-risk verticals — offering real recurring billing, CBD/Hemp merchant approval, and integrations with platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and Chargebee.</p>
